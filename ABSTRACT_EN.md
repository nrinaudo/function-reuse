# Talk Abstract

Functors, monads, and such abstractions can be both very useful and extremely intimidating.

The purpose of this talk is to introduce and justify them in a real life scenario, staying away from their more academic interpretations. It should allow attendants to build a solid intuition for the problems they actually solve, and how they solve them.

# Talk Description

The Function Programming literature is full of words like Monad, Functor, ... which can be a little bit intimidating at first. Most explanations tend to not help much with that - encoding effects, category theory... this can be properly terrifying for down-to-earth developers that just want to write some code.

The purpose of this talk is to show how these abstractions come up very naturally in very concrete projects, and how they allow you to think about the problem you're trying to solve rather than focus on irrelevant noise.

At the end of the talk, attendants will have a solid intuition for what Functor, Apply, Applicative, FlatMap and Monad are, what problem they solve and how, and when (or when not) to use them.
